		<h1><b>Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon, Iceland</b><hr /></h1>
<!--Why you should travel here-->
	<h2><strong>Why should I travel here?</strong></h2>
		<p>Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon in Iceland is unique in many ways. First, it is located
		next to Europe's largest glacier, Vatnajokull. Next, within Iceland, there is only
		3 national parks, and Jokulsarlon is part of one, characterized by its ice, highlands,
		lava landscape, and glaciers. Next, this lagoon is a prime demonstration of global
		 warming, as every year the ice melts, making the lagoon bigger and bigger. This makes
		 each visit different and special. Finally,Jokulsarlon offers something most beaches
		cannot: <b>black sand</b>. Although the sand is covered by translucent ice, the beach 
		still has gleaming black sand underneath the pure ice.

	<h2><strong>Additional Information about the Lagoon</strong></h2>
		<p> Besides the geographical context of the Lagoon, Jokulsarlon also features
		a lot of wildlife, including seals, birds, and sometimes puffins! In order to see this
		amazing Iceland resource, one must drive from the closest city of Reykjavik or go
		 on a tour to the lagoon. From Reykjavik, it is a scenic 6 hour drive, featuring waterfalls, 
		 a black beach, and the Eyjafjallajokull volcano. Tours include going on an amphibian
		 boat around the lake(takes a few hours), participating in a glacier hike, or going
		 ice caving from the natural blue cave within the Vatnajokull glacier.The Lagoon offers
		 a variety of activities for every age, so plan on visiting for more than one day to 
		 get the full experience of the wonders of Jokulsarlon Glacier Lagoon!

	<h4><strong>Reviews</strong></h4>
		<p>
			<h5>Long Drive from Reykjavik but Totally Worth it</h5>
				The icebergs and landscape change every time I go! This Lagoon offers much more
				than just sight seeing too! -Zac E
			<h5>A Good Place to Visit with the Whole Family</h5>
				Taking this trip to Jokularlon was probably the most memorable part of my holiday
				in Iceland due to the beautiful views. -Brad P
			<h5>Good Place to Visit, although Crowded</h5>
				Jokulsarlon was a wonderful place to visit but the parking was a little crowded.
				It is best to spend all day there to enjoy all it has to offer. It starts to 
				become less crowded after 3 pm. -Taylor S
